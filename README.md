# About

This site contains two proposals for improvement of current PKI system. Every proposal is written to be:
 - **Actionable**: Every proposal has a specific audience, a party which has technical ability to adapt said proposal (without the need to obtain permission from all other participants in the system).
 - **Technically trivial to implement**: Proposal is simple to adapt.
 - **Technically trivial to revert**: Once implemented, proposal can be undone without causing any disruptions to the ecosystem.
 - **Compatible**: Adoption of a proposal should not cause compatibility disruptions for existing systems.
 - **Independent from each other**: Either proposal can be implented individually because it does not rely on the other.

While I arrived to these ideas by myself, I do not claim originality of these ideas (since they are rather simple and trivial). Since I could not find anyone else proposing these ideas, I decided to write them up to start a discussion. I find these ideas rather neat and would like to share them with anyone interested.

# Proposals

1. [Each browsers should create Certificate Authorities for the sole purpose of signing certificates for "real" Certificate Authorities](./Compatibility CA.md)
